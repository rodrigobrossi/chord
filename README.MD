It's an internet sample of how an Chord algorithm works in terms of naming and distribuite and node in an overlayer network. 

In computing, Chord is a protocol and algorithm for a peer-to-peer distributed hash table. A distributed hash table stores key-value pairs by assigning keys to different computers (known as "nodes"); a node will store the values for all the keys for which it is responsible.
